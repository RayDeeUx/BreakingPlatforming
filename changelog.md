# BreakingPlatforming Changelog
## v1.2.4
- Experimental iOS support.
## v1.2.3
- Minor code refactoring.
- Brought back "Mark as MultiActivate" option for macOS users thanks to complete bindings.
## v1.2.2
- Port to 2.2074.
## v1.2.1
- Port to 2.206. Big thanks to CatXus, Aktimoose, ninXout, and hiimjustin000 for helping out with testing!
- Remove the "Mark as MultiActivate" option for macOS users due to incomplete bindings.
- Add suggested dependency for ML500's "Checkpoint Vibe Check"/"Is 'Disable checkpoints' on?" mod.
## v1.2.0
- Add macOS support.
- Added a new toggle to disable the platformer squish jumping animation.
- Fix a bug where speed portals could not be marked as multiactivated.
## v1.1.1
- Apply a temporary (and toggleable) fix caused by accessing the garage before playing a level from the EditLevelLayer. ***This setting is off by default (so the crash will still happen) as toggling it on prevents you from entering the garage at all.***
## v1.1.0
- Change conditions for the checkpoints notifications due to an odd crash.
- *Technically*, this is the initial release for the Geode index, but there have been several notable changes between v1.0.0 and v1.1.0 that it's best to release a new version now to make sure everyone updates to this version.
## v1.0.0
- Initial release (on GitHub).
