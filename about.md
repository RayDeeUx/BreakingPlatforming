# BreakingPlatforming

"Platformer level creators hate this one simple trick!"

Ever wondered if a platformer level has checkpoints? Want to tailor every platformer level to your preferences without constantly opening/reopening the level editor? Have at it with BreakingPlatforming.

Adjust every setting related to solid blocks (and gameplay elements) to your heart's content. (Well, *almost* every setting. "NoTouch" is still quite difficult to deal with and has been supplemented with a toggleable Noclip-esque option for hazards only.)
